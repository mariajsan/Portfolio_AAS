| Purpose/Justification|
| --- |
| “The vid of knowledge” is a company that offers technology tools based on knowledge management and preservation. However, due to the high competitiveness of the market and the current and changing conditions, through a market study on other similar platforms, it has been determined the convenience of providing an application related to the "knowledge search" using an online platform.|
 
| Brief project description|
| --- |
| Implement an online platform based on the search of knowledge, allowing access to an organized topics catalog, as well as the creation of a new topic so it can be registered in the platform, allowing it to be rated by different users.|

| --- |
| **Yes** The following elements are contemplated within the Initial Scope of the Project:                                  1.-  Analysis of functional requirements 2.- Platform interface design 3.- 
Topic registration functionality 4.- Topic evaluation functionality 5.- Topic search functionality 6.-Start-up of the platform hosted in the cloud. ** No ** is contemplated within the scope of the project:  1.- The development of CRUD or user registration to the platform 2.- Hiring of hosting services 3.- Drafting of all the topics of the platform|
 
| Expected project results/Benefits|
| --- |
| The benefits that are foreseen with this project is that as the platform begins to be used by users and it can be enriched with topics, searches can be carried out as well as being able to give evaluations to each topic and be able to present data analytics to the company so that the performance of the platform can be observed.|
 
| High-level project requirements||
| --- | --- |
| **Requirement**|**Success criteria**|
| To offer users a platform that is available at all times, that is easy to use and attractive, as well as guaranteeing the security of the information that is registered there. The service object of this act will be terminated once the platform is considered secure and the security of the user's information is guaranteed.|
|When a user writes a topic, they will be offered a catalog with related and existing topics. | This requirement is considered fulfilled once the user is allowed to view a considerable amount of topics and can enrich their knowledge when searching for topics using keywords of interest. |
|Allow published topics to also attach photos, videos or presentations with a maximum size and duration limit. | This requirement will be terminated once users add new topics to the platform and these can be made public to the rest of the users.|
|Offer the user the power to consult the topics that have been registered as well as the power to download the referenced documents locally. | This requirement will be terminated once the users can carry out specialized searches and evaluate them and they can be available for the rest of the users.|
|Offer data analytics on the topics that are more concurrent, the topics to users who do not find the topic that shows a similar topic, using the recommendations or solutions made by the system itself. This stage is considered completed when the company is able to access the graphs and statistics about the performance of the platform over the next 3 months of implementation.|
